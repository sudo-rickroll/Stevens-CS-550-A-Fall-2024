| Briefly explain each of several reasons for creating a cluster. Give an example of each reason | 1.	Horizontal Scaling: Clustering provides more computing power. <br/>Ex: If more VRam is required for running a certain ML model, machines can be clustered together to accommodate for the same. <br/><br/>2.	Redundancy: Fail-over clustering provides fault-tolerant systems. This prevents downtime and also helps with minimal to no downtime during disaster recovery. <br/>Ex: If a node fails due to a machine’s malfunctioning CPU, an alternate node in the cluster can handle the load. <br/><br/>3.	High-availability: Clustering offers for a vast geo-availability, where machines would be scattered across different regions, thus offering lower latency. <br/>Ex: A user in India can access a system in Asia or a region nearby to query a database. This would result in receiving the result faster than when trying to access a system that is in, let’s say Australia. <br/><br/>4.	Load-balancing: When there is high traffic, the processing could be distributed among multiple systems to avoid overloading a particular system. <br/>Ex: Multiple gateways could be created in Power BI to grant access to data to different teams in a large organization, so that all of them can access this data simultaneously. | Englander, IRV., Wong, W.

| What is a “loosely coupled” computer system? How does it differ from a “tighly coupled” system? | Loosely coupled systems have components that can function independently. Whereas tightly coupled systems have interdependent components. Loosely-coupled systems are also called multicomputer systems. Some loosely coupled systems share a storage device resource or a small amount of memory that can be used to communicate between the different computers. The determining factor that distinguishes a loosely coupled system is the autonomy of each computer within the system complex or network. There are two basic methods of connecting loosely coupled computers. Clustered computers are connected directly together with a dedicated communication channel or link that passes messages between machines. The key to the cluster concept is that the cluster is designed to operate as a single autonomous system sharing a workload. Conversely, networked computers operate more independently. The data communication channel between networked machines is used primarily to exchange and share data and external resources, rather than to share the actual processing. | 1.	Harold, Bell.
