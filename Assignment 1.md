| Briefly explain each of several reasons for creating a cluster. Give an example of each reason | 1.    Horizontal Scaling: Clustering provides more computing power. <br/>Ex: If more VRam is required for running a certain ML model, machines can be clustered together to accommodate for the same. <br/><br/>2.	Redundancy: Fail-over clustering provides fault-tolerant systems. This prevents downtime and also helps with minimal to no downtime during disaster recovery. <br/>Ex: If a node fails due to a machine’s malfunctioning CPU, an alternate node in the cluster can handle the load. <br/><br/>3.    High-availability: Clustering offers for a vast geo-availability, where machines would be scattered across different regions, thus offering lower latency. <br/>Ex: A user in India can access a system in Asia or a region nearby to query a database. This would result in receiving the result faster than when trying to access a system that is in, let’s say Australia. <br/><br/>4.    Load-balancing: When there is high traffic, the processing could be distributed among multiple systems to avoid overloading a particular system. <br/>Ex: Multiple gateways could be created in Power BI to grant access to data to different teams in a large organization, so that all of them can access this data simultaneously. | Englander, IRV., Wong, W.

| What is a “loosely coupled” computer system? How does it differ from a “tighly coupled” system? | Loosely coupled systems have components that can function independently. Whereas tightly coupled systems have interdependent components. Loosely-coupled systems are also called multicomputer systems. Some loosely coupled systems share a storage device resource or a small amount of memory that can be used to communicate between the different computers. The determining factor that distinguishes a loosely coupled system is the autonomy of each computer within the system complex or network. There are two basic methods of connecting loosely coupled computers. Clustered computers are connected directly together with a dedicated communication channel or link that passes messages between machines. The key to the cluster concept is that the cluster is designed to operate as a single autonomous system sharing a workload. Conversely, networked computers operate more independently. The data communication channel between networked machines is used primarily to exchange and share data and external resources, rather than to share the actual processing. | 1.    Harold, Bell.

Hybrid clouds are a form of multi-clouds. A hybrid cloud can become a true multi-cloud if it involves more that one public cloud. There are a number of advantages and a number of major risks to an organization for IT system architects to consider when making decisions about a system design involving services in the cloud. Multi-cloud systems provide for better scalability whereas hybrid clouds provide for better security. Multi-cloud allows businesses to adopt a variety of cloud solutions.<br/><br/>Some of the advantages:<br/>1.	The client’s data center is simplified and the cost reduced. It is not necessary to provide, support, and maintain individual copies of software for every user, nor to develop software that is already available from a cloud service provider, nor to purchase software that is only occasionally needed. Hardware purchase, configuration, power management, and maintenance are all potentially reduced and simplified.<br/>2.    Cloud services provide strong support for user collaboration, since multiple users can easily access the same software, databases, tools, and data files from the cloud.<br/>3.    Properly designed, with the proper client applications, cloud services can be accessed on a wide variety of client equipment, fixed or mobile, thick or thin, from anywhere the Internet is available |
